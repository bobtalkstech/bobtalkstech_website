# Production schedule
<a id="production_schedule"/>
I'm currently working on these topics for my series on getting started
with the Internet of Things using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Internet of Things
(IoT) services. Videos should start appearing in August 2020 in the order they
are listed here.

If you have a suggestion for a future topic, please send it to: blog@bobtalkstech.com.

## Coming in August 2020

1. **_Demystifying the Internet of Things (IoT)_**<br />An overview and introduction to the
Internet of Things for the very beginner. This video introduces the fundamental
terms and concepts of systems built on the Internet of Things. There is no coding
in this video.
1. **_Hands-on tour of an IoT system_**<br />A walkthrough of an interactive IoT system
simulation that illustrates the basic functions of an IoT solution at a functional
level. There is no coding in this video.

## Coming in September 2020

1. **_Building the IoT system tour app - step 0_**<br />This is the first of a series
of videos in which we'll build the system that the hands-on tour demonstrates.
Using a Python on a Raspberry Pi and some hardware attached to the Pi's GPIO,
we'll build a simple device that lights LEDs in response to pressing a button. (No IoT, yet.)
1. **_Building the IoT system tour app - step 1_**<br />In this video we'll continue
to build the system from the hands-on tour by connecting the Raspberry Pi from the
previous video to IoT, so that when we press a button on one Pi, it will light the
LED on another using IoT Messaging.
1. **_Building the IoT system tour app - step 2_**<br />In this video we'll continue
developing the system that the hands-on tour demonstrates by adding an IoT rule to alter
the color of the LED illuminated after a button press.
1. **_Building the IoT system tour app - step 3_**<br />In this video we'll continue
developing the system that the hands-on tour demonstrates by adding more IoT rules
to perform additional actions based on the buttons pressed on the Raspberry Pi.
1. **_Building the IoT system tour app - step 4_**<br />In this video we'll develop
the system further by adding a device shadow so that the display device can  
reflect activity that takes place while it was offline.
