Still in pre-production. I have the video production workflow sorted out for the
first few videos. However, I decided a few weeks ago that having some code samples would
make the videos that follow the introduction more interesting. As a result, I've
been building and testing the software for the subsequent videos so that I'll
be able to release them shortly after the introduction.

As with all things IoT, so far, the mysteries continue to abound. Creating these
samples has identified some gaps in the documentation. As the technical writer
who is responsible for that content, identifying these has given me some more
work to do during my day job. Hopefully, I'll have paved over all the potholes
in the road to understanding by the time I publish the videos so you'll have a
smooth journey.
