## Disclaimer

I'm currently a technical writer for Amazon Web Services; however, the views,
opinions, and thoughts presented on this site are mine alone and do not
necessarily represent the views of my employer or any other individual or
organization.

## More about me

With the disclaimer out of the way, a little be more about me.

I've been employed in technology and engineering for most of the past 40 years.
Some of the more interesting detours I've taken along the way include spending
time as a filmmaker and university professor. This project provides the perfect
opportunity to bring all these diverse aspects from my experience into a single
medium.

As a developer and now as a technical writer, my professional
satisfaction has come from knowing that what I'm working on improves the life
of someone else. My goal for this content is that it gets you as excited about
the technologies as I am and helps you apply them to the benefit of your
customers.
