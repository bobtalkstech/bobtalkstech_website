(IoT) services. I expect to start posting these by August 2020.

in this video.
1. _*Hands-on tour of an IoT system*_<br />A walkthrough of an interactive IoT system
simulation that illustrates the basic functions of an IoT solution at a functional
level. There is no coding in this video.
1. _*Connect your laptop as a thing*_<br />A demo of getting started with
AWS IoT by using a laptop as an IoT device and connecting it to your AWS IoT
account. This demonstrates the steps of setting up a simple IoT solution
without the need for a device. There is some coding in this video.
1. _*Connect a Raspberry Pi as a thing*_<br />Continues from the previous video on
getting started with AWS IoT by connecting a Raspberry Pi as an IoT device to your
AWS IoT account. This demonstrates the steps of setting up a simple IoT solution
